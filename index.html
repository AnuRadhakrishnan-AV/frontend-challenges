             <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
             <p>To make a basic omelette, you will need eggs, a fat like butter or oil, and seasonings like salt and pepper. For a more advanced omelette, you can add fillings like cheese, chopped vegetables (onions, peppers, tomatoes), and various meats (ham, bacon).  </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Eggs: 2-3 per omelette
                    <li>Fat: Butter or oil for the pan</li>
                    <li>Seasoning: Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Liquid (optional): A splash of milk, cream, or water to make the eggs fluffier </li>

               <h3> Instructions</h3>
               <ol>
                <li>Prepare your ingredients. Crack the eggs into the bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, along with the milk or water if you are using it. Whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly frothy. If adding fillings, have them chopped and ready to go.</li>
                <li>Heat the pan. Place your non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt until it is foaming. Swirl the pan to ensure the bottom is evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs. Pour the egg mixture into the heated pan. The edges should set immediately. Tilt the pan slightly to help the eggs spread evenly.</li>
                <li>Move the eggs. As the edges begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the cooked portions from the edges toward the center. Tilt and rotate the skillet so the uncooked liquid egg can flow into the empty spaces.</li>
                <li>Add fillings. When the eggs are almost set but the top still looks moist, sprinkle your fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
                <li>Fold the omelette. Use your spatula to gently lift the unfilled side of the omelette and fold it over the side with the fillings.</li>
                <li>Finish cooking. Continue to cook for another minute or two, allowing the fillings to warm and the eggs to fully set. The residual heat will melt any cheese.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately. Carefully slide the omelette out of the pan and onto a plate. Serve hot. </li>
